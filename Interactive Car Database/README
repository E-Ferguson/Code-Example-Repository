This project was a ground-up application designed to allow users to interact with a car database.  Functionality included the ability to look up cars based on make and model, the option to search for cars based on certain fields (horsepower, fuel efficiency, etc),  and a car-matching option that would find similar cars based on a user-supplied one.  The user interface was a Tkinter GUI and the backend was written in Python code with embedded SQL.

I did the majority of the work on the design, writing most of the code for projectDriver.py carLookup.py, and carCategorize.py.
